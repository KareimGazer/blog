# The KISS Principle

Keep It Simple Stupid

---

This principle was drawn from aircraft engineering by Kelly Johnson who stated that all systems work better if they are kept simple.

Unix follows this philosophy by making each program do one thing well, and do a new job to build a fresh new program rather than complicating old programs by adding new features.
